# Foras
Create datasets for the FORAS project using OpenAlex

## Downloading the OpenAlex data
To download the OpenAlex data on works, run `python foras/download_data.py` from the
root of the repository. This will download all the files and put them in a directory
called `data`. Note that this is approximately 330GB of data (October 2023 snapshot).
