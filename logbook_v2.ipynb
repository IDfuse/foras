    "## Vectorizing OpenAlex\n",
    "For the other methods I needed to have a feature matrix just like we use in ASReview. I used a multilingual sentence transformers model (https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-small) to vectorize all records in OpenAlex with a title or abstract. This gave me a around 640GB of vectors, which I uploaded to Huggingface Datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/GlobalCampus/openalex-multilingual-embeddings/tree/main) so that other can use them as well. Next I took the vectors of records with publication date from 2015 onwards and fed them to a search engine (https://vespa.ai/). So the set in which I search is the records in OpenAlex with title or abstract, and a publication date at least 2015. This results in approximately 85 million records. Now I can search in the dataset for texts that are close to a query text:\n",
    "- I turn the text into a vector\n",
    "- I send the vector to the search engine, it gives me back the `N` closest vectors. (This uses Vespa to create an HNSW index based on cosine similarity between the vectors. The details on the Vespa implementation of the HSNW index can be found here in (https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html) and it is based on the original paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320) )\n",
    "- I look up the information of those `N` vectors in OpenAlex.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did this in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method 2: Semantic Search using inclusion criteria\n",
    "For this method used the inclusion criteria of the systematic review as the input text, as can found in the section 'Inclusion criteria' uner 'Types of study to be included' from (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=494027). I got back the 1000 records that are closest to these inclusion criteria."
